Customer Behavior using KNN

This project explores customer behavior by applying the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The goal is to analyze customer data, predict patterns, and classify customer behavior to gain actionable insights. Through KNN, customer segmentation can be achieved based on features such as purchasing history, demographics, and preferences. This project helps businesses tailor their services, offers, and communication strategies, improving customer satisfaction and increasing retention.

Key objectives include:
#Predicting potential customer categories.
#Understanding customer purchasing trends and behavior.
#Supporting targeted marketing strategies through data-driven decisions.
#The project leverages Python libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib to perform data preprocessing, KNN classification, and visualization of results.
